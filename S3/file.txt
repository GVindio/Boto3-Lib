The Quiet Hours

In the quiet hours of the morning,
When the world whispers low,
The gentle hush cloaks the dawning,
With a soft and golden glow.

Leaves rustle with a secret,
A murmur through the trees,
The air, cool and exquisite,
Carries stories in its breeze.

Silence is a canvas,
Painted with the dawn's light hues,
Each moment holds a promise,
Of the freshness morning brews.

As the sun climbs, ever higher,
The day begins to sing,
But in these quiet moments prior,
Peace is a tangible thing.
